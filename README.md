# NEXUS: The Campus Super-App

> "The digital nervous system for campus life, intelligently connecting academics, daily routines, social coordination, and decision-making using AI."

![NEXUS Cover](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600/0a192f/64ffda?text=NEXUS+Command+Center)

## 🚀 Vision

NEXUS isn't just an app; it's an **intelligence layer**. It solves the problem of campus fragmentation by connecting isolated data points (timetables, emails, events) into a cohesive stream of actionable insights.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Anticipate, don't just respond.** (e.g., "You have a 2-hour gap; the library is empty right now.")
- **Everything connected.** (e.g., A lost item post is automatically shown to people who had classes in that room.)
- **Premium Aesthetics.** A clean, "Command Center" interface that commands respect.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Visuals:** HTML5 Canvas (Neural Network Background), Lucide Icons
- **Backend:** Node.js (Serverless API Routes), Prisma ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Docker)
- **Authentication:** Custom JWT Implementation
- **AI:** Simulated LLM Abstraction (Ready for OpenAI Integration)

## 🤖 AI Logic & Features

### 1. Mail Summarizer
- **Problem:** Students miss critical deadlines in long emails.
- **Solution:** NLP extraction of deadlines, priority scoring, and action items.
- **Logic:** `NexusIntelligence.analyze('MAIL', content)` returns a structured JSON with `confidence`, `summary`, and `deadlines`.

### 2. Free-Time Oracle
- **Problem:** Wasted gaps between classes.
- **Solution:** Analyzes the `Timetable` model to find gaps > 45 mins. Cross-references with `CrowdData` (mocked) to suggest optimal locations (e.g., "Library is 70% empty").

### 3. Daily Pulse
- **Problem:** Information overload.
- **Solution:** Real-time aggregation of Mess Menus, Bus Schedules, and Event Alerts in a single view.
